Warning! Spoilers for Wolverine: Weapons of Armageddon #1 ahead!
Marvel is setting Wolverine on a collision course with the modern-day Weapon X, highlighting the fact that the organization that turned him into a killer has always been the mutant hero's real arch-enemy, rather than Sabretooth. It might be easier to write stories pitting Logan against his dark counterpart, but Wolverine truly shines when battling bigger, more nefarious forces.
Wolverine: Weapons of Armageddon #1 is written by Chip Zdarsky, with art by Luca Maresca. It is the official start to the road to Armageddon, Marvel's major crossover for the year.
Wolverine's confrontation with the private Weapon X offshoot "Primeweapon" makes it clear that the X-Men stalwart is still the best at what he does: taking down unjust institutions.
Sabretooth Isn't Really Wolverine's Greatest Villain, The Weapin X Program And It's Successors Deserve That Title
Wolverine: Weapons of Armageddon #1, Written By Chip Zdarsky; Art By Luca Maresca; Available Now From Marvel Comics
Wolverine exemplifies the trope of a hero who has been used by a villainous institution, and is now going to bring it down at all costs. That institution is Weapon X, the black ops program that grafted adamantium to his bones, and wiped his mind repeatedly, all in an effort to turn him into a living weapon.
Fighting Weapon X is the best way for Wolverine to reckon with his trauma.
Weapon X and its many off-shoots were the catalyst for Wolverine's decades-long redemption story. Readers just got a condensed version of this story in Marvel's Ultimate Wolverine series, which started with Logan as a brainwashed killer, before he broke free of his captors' control and was then unleashed on them.
Sabretooth is generally accepted as Wolverine's greatest nemesis, and on a 1-v-1 level that's true. However, Wolverine is more than just one of Marvel's greatest fighters. Wolverine embodies the desire to be a hero more overtly than any other Marvel character. This is tied to his past victimization. And fighting Weapon X is the best way for Wolverine to reckon with his trauma.
Sabretooth Is An Even Match For Wolverine; Fighting Weapon X Lets Him Take On Something Bigger Than Himself
Wolverine Is At His Heroic Best As An Underdog
Sabretooth represents the dark path Wolverine refuses to go down. He's the evil counterpart, a classic villainous trope. His rivalry with Logan is inarguably one of the most iconic in Marvel history. Yet it's fair to say Weapon X is the actual greatest antagonist in Wolverine lore. Weapon X is the villain that lets Logan punch up, instead of being evenly matched.
There's something cathartic about Wolverine taking on Weapon X that isn't there in his battles with Sabretooth, or Omega Red, or any of his other perennial adversaries. Weapon X and its derivatives, including the new "Primeweapon" from Weapons of Armageddon #1, are a whole level of dangerous above what any single Marvel villain can be.
As such, there are few moments more triumphant than when Wolverine shutters another incarnation of the abusive experimental program. That's also why versions of Weapon X will always keep coming back, and why Weapons of Armageddon sets its latest succesor up as the tip of the iceberg for Wolverine and Marvel's next big epochal event.
Wolverine: Weapons of Armageddon #1 is available now from Marvel Comics.
