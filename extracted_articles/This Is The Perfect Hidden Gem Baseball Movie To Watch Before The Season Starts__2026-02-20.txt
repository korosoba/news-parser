The 2026 Major League Baseball season is on the horizon and that means it's a great time to check out a movie about the sport. We all know the most iconic baseball films, from The Sandlot to A League of Their Own, and while those are great to rewatch, there's something extra fun about finding a new gem.
Film history is littered with tales about baseball that fly under the radar, whether it's Mr. 3000, Everybody Wants Some!! or For Love of the Game. One of the most recent baseball films, Eephus, is a hidden gem along those lines that really speaks to people who have a deep love for the sport.
Eephus Is A Great Baseball Movie
Eephus debuted at the Cannes Film Festival in 2024 before getting its United States release in March 2025. The movie tells a simple, yet effective story as it follows a group of amateur baseball players as they play their final game together before their stadium is demolished.
The film receives a boost from how well it sets up the timeframe and location, set in Massachusetts in the '90s. However, the true place where this shines is in how it treats the game of baseball. For these people, it's something special and you can see them looking to hold onto it for as long as possible.
Critical reception for Eephus, a film named after the high-arcing off-speed pitch, was stellar. In fact, with nearly 100 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, it still has an outstanding 100% rating. It was up for the Camera d'Or at Cannes and won several awards from various film critics and festivals.
What Makes Eephus Perfect To Watch Before The MLB Season
Eephus is an ideal movie to watch with baseball season approaching. The characters involved aren't professionals making a ton of money, so they're out there for the love of the game. They have friends, families, and jobs, but for the time being, this game is the most important thing to them.
These guys are showcased like true amateurs, not always running the bases in good form and making errors from time to time. As the film progresses, night falls and the guys can barely see, but they want to keep playing because letting go of this game, for the last time, is too difficult.
The movie also includes the stuff that baseball diehards love, including a loyal fan who is scoring the game. Seeing that kind of admiration for the game only boosts your own appreciation for it, which is just what you want going into a new season. Every baseball fan needs to give Eephus a chance.
