How to Train Your Dragon 2 is bringing back another actor from the animated films to reprise their role, but it is a reminder of the sequel's most heartbreaking storyline. Universal showed a lot of confidence in Dreamworks' remake of How to Train Your Dragon by announcing the sequel before the first premiered in theaters.
Fortunately, the bet paid off, as the film was a hit with critics and at the box office. It earned a 77% critic score on Rotten Tomatoes and grossed over $636.3 million worldwide. The remake stayed very close to the original, even having Gerard Butler return as Stoick, the character he voiced in the animated films.
Butler is back again for the sequel, and will now be joined by Cate Blanchett as Valka, who she voiced in the second and third animated films. Her return to the franchise is exciting, but it also means that one story moment may be even more upsetting.
Cate Blanchett And Gerard Butler May Not Have Much Screen Time Together
Spoilers for the original How To Train Your Dragon trilogy followHTTYD 2 is set to release on June 11, 2027, and has recently added a few more stars to its cast. In addition to Blanchett's return as Valka, Ted Lasso's Phil Dunster is set to play Eret, previously voiced by Kit Harington, and Severance's Ólafur Darri Ólaffson will portray the villain Drago Bludvist, voiced by Djimon Hounsou in the original film.
Valka is Hiccup's mother and Stoick's wife, who was believed to be dead for several years following a battle with dragons. However, it's revealed in the sequel that she was taken by the dragons and has been living among them. She reunites with Stoick and Hiccup in the sequel, and teaches Hiccup many secrets about the powerful beasts.
She returns in How to Train Your Dragon 3, staying with Hiccup in Berk. Valka was not in the first remake, but her name is mentioned by Gobber, slightly teasing her return in the upcoming sequel. It will be exciting to see Stoick and Valka reunite in live-action, but their reunion may only last for a few scenes.
One of the most memorable moments in the animated films is when Stoick reunites with Valka. He's not angry with her for leaving – he's relieved that she's still alive, and he'd never lost his love for her. However, their beautiful reunion is cut short.
Shortly after the two reconnect, Stoick dies in the battle against Drago. During the fight, Drago's Bewilderbeast becomes the new alpha after killing the other one. Drago uses the alpha to brainwash Toothless into attacking Hiccup. However, Stoick jumps in front of Hiccup, sacrificing himself and getting hit by Toothless' fiery blast.
It's a devastating moment, and it means that Butler and Blanchett may not have much screen time together, assuming the sequel sticks close to the original story. They have more scenes together, as the first remake was longer than the original, but the extra runtime was for added moments rather than wholesale story changes.
It is exciting that Butler and Blanchett will portray Stoick and Valka's relationship in live-action, but it is bittersweet, knowing what happens in the sequel. Still, it's great that Blanchett is returning for How to Train Your Dragon 2, which will hopefully be just as impactful as the original.
